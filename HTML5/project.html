It also just got the first season of its TV series released on Disney+. This is a way shorter series than Harry Potter with a little less than 500,000 total words.</p>

                <p>This is a great and short series for anybody looking for a more adult and dystopian fictional book series. The fourth book is not a continuation of the other three but it can be read as a prologue to the actual story of the Hunger Games.</p>
